There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) 
and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number 
of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.

Example 1:
Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.

Example 2:
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "lt"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "leet" because the 'l' and 't' keys are broken.

Example 3:
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "e"
Output: 0
Explanation: We cannot type either word because the 'e' key is broken.


annotations:
   - In this question we need to run through the "words" string and "brokenLetters" string.
     when whe found some letter from brokeLetters in words, whe can use a break steatment 
     to stop the loop and go for the next interation because that word cant be write anymore.
     We also can use a iterator variable, to count how many words can be writed.

     for example:
	word = "hello world"
	term = "ad"

	#counter start in zero.
        counter = 0

 	# we run through the word string, which in first case will be "hello". We are using split() method
	# to separated the two strings from the variable "word".
        for word in text.split():
	    
	    # now, when run through the term string, which in the first case, will be "a".
            for letter in brokenLetters:

		# if exists "a" in hello, the second loop will stop because the break steatment. if not, the second loop runs again with
	        # now looking for letter "d" in hello. There is no "a" or "d" in hello, so the loop finishs
	        # and return to first loop, now using the word "world" to make the verifications.
                if letter in word:
                    break
	    
	    # if the code never fall in that if, the code runs that else statemant, incrementing the counter variable.
            else:
                counter+=1

	# and now we return the counter to see how many word we can write.
        return counter
