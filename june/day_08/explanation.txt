Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits). 
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits). 
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
7896 contains 4 digits (even number of digits). 
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits.

annotations:
   - In that question, we need to discover how many of them contain an even number of digits.
     example: 12 has 2 digits, he is even.

   - We cant use len() to discover the quantity of digits in a int variable, but wen can use in a string.
     So, to resolve that question, we can turn this digits is a string and use len in each number to
     calculate, if module of len in a digit its 0, the number of the digit its even.
     
     number = 12
     counter = 0
     example:
       - val = len(str(number)). Now that we have len() value, we can use module to calculate.
         if val % 2 == 0 we increment counter variable and return that variable. And that's it.
