Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.

annotations.
 - in this question, we need to find the larger number closest to zero, so that are my approaching.
   - Create two lists, one for negative numbers and another for postivie numbers.

   - After that i populate a list with all numbers, if the number its negative, i turn him positive before appending.

   - And to finish i use min() in that list to get the minimun number, and use "if" to see if that number are in 
     negative list or positive list.

   - If the number are in both lists (negative and positive) i return the positive value, if are in negative i return
     negative value and if are in positive, i return the positive value
